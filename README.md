# ANALYZING MINNEAPOLIS CRIME DATA OVER TIME #

Analyzing Minneapolis Crime Data over 6 years from 2010 to 2016

The topic of crime and public safety casts a wide net, touching upon the lives of all citizens in an area. We each pay taxes at a local and state level to fund our police departments and their efforts in the hopes that crime will be reduced and our neighborhoods will be safe. New citizens to the area have a unique challenge, without previous knowledge of the area or its history. In an effort to inform new and current citizens of the historical crime patterns as well as provide predictive measures of future crime, we set out to perform an analysis of a variety of crime related factors. Through this analysis we will look to present visual and numeric historical crime trends, provide a tool for citizens to use to rate crime in an area, and describe a predictive model that can be used to forecast future crimes by area.
